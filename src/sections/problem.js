        <h2>Our Problem</h2>
        <p className='description'>
          <b><span className='emphasis'>The Pflugerville City Council is currently considering a partnership with the Williamson County

          (WILCO) Animal Shelter</span></b>.Â They will be investing approx. $2 million dollars of our tax money to

          expand the WILCO shelter to accommodate the additional animals. The city will also contribute

          approx. $200,000 per year for maintenance. After the bond initiative for a new shelter was narrowly

          defeated last November, the city council promised to upgrade the existing facilities to meet the

          needs of the shelter. A $1.8 million dollar building was proposed on the existing site, which would

          house the kennels for the animals as well as storage and grooming areas.

          The city council has not yet abandoned the current expansion plan, they are simply gathering all the

          information before making a decision. There is also a third option that would include partnering

          with the WILCO shelter but keeping the Pflugerville shelter open for intake only. The animals would

          be held for a certain amount of days and then transferred to WILCO. We feel this option is the least

          efficient and most expensive. Keeping the shelter open for intake would still require upgrades to

          the facility, and t would still have operating costs and staff requirements.

          The residents of Pflugerville need to have a say in whatever the ultimate decision is. The WILCO

          shelter is over 15 miles away for most Pflugerville residents, which would greatly reduce animal

          reclaims and stray drop-offs. If there was not an intake center in Pflugerville, Animal Control

          Officers and police officers would have to drive 30-40 miles round trip every time they drop off an

          animal. We do not think this is the best use of our resources.

          The Friends of the Pflugerville Animal Shelter want your help in letting our city council know that

          they are not acting in the best interest of the city and its residents. The city has proposed to hold a

          town hall meeting on a third Tuesday (they meet every second and fourth Tuesday) to allow

          residents to speak on the issue. As soon as we have a date for this meeting, we will post it on our

          site.

          Pflugerville deserves their own shelter. They have the population and the tax base to support it. We

          know what if we all work together, we can build a shelter the city can be proud of, a shelter that

          benefits both the animals and the residents.
